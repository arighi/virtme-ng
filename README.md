What is KernelCraft?
====================

KernelCraft is a tool that allows to setup a lab to experiment different
kernel versions in a safe virtualized environment, re-using the entire
filesystem of the running machine as a safe live-copy, without affecting
the real filesystem of the host.

KernelCraft is based on virtme by Andy Lutomirski <luto@kernel.org>
([web][korg-web] | [git][korg-git]).
