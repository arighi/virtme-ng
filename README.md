What is KernelCraft?
====================

KernelCraft is a tool that allows to easily and quickly recompile and test a
Linux kernel, starting from the source code.

It allows to recompile the kernel in few minutes (rather than hours), then the
kernel is automatically started in a virtualized environment that is an exact
copy-on-write copy of your live system, which means that any changes made to
the virtualized environment do not affect the host system.

In order to do this a minimal config is produced (with the bare minimum support
to test the kernel inside qemu), then the selected kernel is automatically
built and started inside qemu, using the filesystem of the host as a
copy-on-write snapshot.

This means that you can safely destroy the entire filesystem, crash the kernel,
etc. without affecting the host.

Kernels produced with KernelCraft are lacking lots of features, in order to
reduce the build time to the minimum and still provide you a usable kernel
capable of running your tests and experiments.

Quick start
===========

```
 $ uname -r
 5.19.0-23-generic
 $ mkdir linux && cd linux
 $ kc --init
 KernelCraft git repository initialized
 $ kc -r mainline --commit v6.1-rc6
 ...
 $ uname -r
 6.1.0-rc6-kc
 ^
 |___ Now you have a shell inside a virtualized copy of your entire system,
      that is running the new kernel

 ("ctrl+a, x" to return back to your real system)
```

Installation
============

If you're running Ubuntu you can install KernelCraft from
ppa:arighi/kernelcraft:
```
 $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:arighi/kernelcraft
 $ sudo apt install --yes kernelcraft
```

Otherwise, you can install via pip directly (after cloning this git
repository):
```
 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt .
```

Requirements
============

KernelCraft requires a customized version of virtme, available here
[web][arighi-virtme].

You may also need to install `crash` to use the memory dump inspection feature
(see example below).

If you are using Ubuntu you can install all the required packages and dependencies from this ppa:
[web][kernelcraft-ppa].

Examples
========

 - Build and run v6.1-rc3 from the public mainline git repository:
```
   $ kc -r mainline -c v6.1-rc3
```

 - Build and run a kernel 2 commits before the previously compiled kernel:
```
   $ kc --commit HEAD~2
```

 - Test the previously built kernel:
```
   $ kc -s
```

 - Only generate .config with the latest mainline kernel:
```
   $ kc -r mainline --kconfig
```

 - Generate and inspect a memory dump of the currently tested kernel (crash
   tool needs to be installed):
```
   $ kc -d
```

 - Save a memory dump of the running kernel to /tmp/vmcore.img
```
   $ kc -d --dump-file /tmp/vmcore.img
```

 - Test the tip of linux-next, building the kernel on a remote build host
   called "builder", including /var/lib/rust-for-linux/bin to the default PATH:
```
   $ kc -r next --build-host arighi@builder \
     --build-host-exec-prefix 'PATH=/var/lib/rust-for-linux/bin:$PATH'
```

 - Test the tip of the latest mainline kernel, building the kernel on a remote
   build host called "builder", running make inside a specific build chroot
   (managed remotely by schroot):
```
   $ kc -r mainline --build-host builder \
     --build-host-exec-prefix "schroot -c chroot:kinetic-amd64 -- "
```

 - Run the previously compiled kernel and enable bridge networking (NOTE: you
   may get permission denied in some Ubuntu releases, I solved by doing a
   `sudo chmod u+s /usr/lib/qemu/qemu-bridge-helper`:
```
   $ kc -s --network bridge
```

 - Run the previously compiled kernel adding an additional virtio-scsi device:
```
   $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 /tmp/disk.img 8G
   $ kc -s --disk /tmp/disk.img
```

 - Recompile the kernel enabling Rust support (using specific versions of the
   Rust toolchain binaries):
```
   $ kc RUSTC=rustc-1.62 BINDGEN=bindgen-0.56 RUSTFMT=rustfmt-1.62
```

 - Test latest mainline kernel on arm64 (using a separate chroot in
   /opt/chroot/arm64 as the main filesystem):
```
   $ kc -r mainline --arch arm64 --root /opt/chroot/arm64/
```

 - Build upstream kernel 6.1-rc6, execute `uname -r` inside it and send the
   output to cowsay on the host:
```
   $ kc -c v6.1-rc6 --exec 'uname -r' 2>/dev/null | cowsay
    ______________
   < 6.1.0-rc6-kc >
    --------------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||
```

 - Run `uname -r` on the host, build upstream kernel v6.1-rc6, pass uname
   output to this kernel, run `uname -r` inside it, send the whole output to
   cowsay back on the host:
```
   $ uname -r | kc -c v6.1-rc6 --exec 'cat -; uname -r' 2>/dev/null | cowsay -n

```

Implementation details
======================

KernelCraft has a list of known git repositories in ~/.kernelcraft.conf, stored
in a JSON format. It is possible to add custom git repositories by changing
this file.

Repositories are identified by name (specified with the option --release / -r).

When a release (git repository) is specified KernelCraft takes care of adding
the remote branch to the local current git repository. When a remote build host
is used (--build-host) the target branch is force pushed to the remote host
inside the ~/.kernelcraft folder.

Then a minimal custom .config is generated using (a custom version of)
virtme-configkernel.

It is possible to specify a set of custom configs (.config chunk) in
~/.kc.config, these user-specific settings will override the default settings
of virtme-configkernel (except for the mandatory configs that are required to
boot and test the kernel inside qemu, using virtme).

Then the kernel is compiled either locally or on an external build host (if the
`--build-host` option is used); once the build is done only the required files
needed to test the kernel are copied from the remote host if an external build
host is used.

Then the kernel is executed using virtme. This allows to test the kernel using
a safe copy-on-write snapshot of the entire host filesystem.

All the kernels compiled with KernelCraft have a `-rc` suffix to their kernel
version, this allows to easily determine if you're inside a KernelCraft kernel
or if you're using the real host kernel (simply by checking `uname -r`).

It is also possible to generate and inspect a memory dump of the tested kernel
running `kc -d` from the host, while the test kernel is running.

External kernel modules
=======================

It is possible to recompile and test out-of-tree kernel modules inside the
KernelCraft kernel, simply by building them against the local directory of the
kernel git repository that was used to build and run the kernel.

Default options
===============

Typically, if you always use kc with an external build server (e.g.,
`kc --build-host REMOTE_SERVER --build-host-exec-prefix CMD`) you don't always
want to specify these options, so instead, you can simply define them in
~/.kernelcraft.conf under `default_opts` and then simply run `kc`.

Example (always use an external build server called 'kathleen' and run make
inside a build chroot called 'chroot:lunar-amd64'). To do so, modify the
`default_opts` sections in ~/.kernelcraft.conf as following:

    "default_opts" : {
        "build_host": "kathleen",
        "build_host_exec_prefix": "schroot -c chroot:lunar-amd64 --"
    },

Now you can simply run `kc` to build your kernel using the external build host,
prepending the exec prefix command when running make.

Troubleshooting
===============

 - If you get permission denied when starting qemu, make sure that your
   username is assigned to the group `kvm` or `libvirt`:
```
  $ groups | grep "kvm\|libvirt"
```

 - When using `--network bridge` to create a bridged network in the guest you
   may get the following error:
```
  ...
  failed to create tun device: Operation not permitted
```

   This is because `qemu-bridge-helper` requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN` permissions.

   To fix this you need to add `allow all` to `/etc/qemu/bridge.conf` and set
   the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability to `qemu-bridge-helper`, as following:
```
  $ sudo filecap /usr/lib/qemu/qemu-bridge-helper net_admin
```

 - If the guest fails to start because the host doesn't have enough memory
   available you can specify a different amount of memory using `--memory MB`,
   (this option is passed directly to qemu via -m, default is 4G).

 - If you're testing a kernel for an architecture different than the host, keep
   in mind that you need to use also `--root DIR` to use a specific chroot with
   the binaries compatible with the architecture that you're testing.

   If the chroot doesn't exist in your system KernelCraft will automatically
   create it using the latest daily build Ubuntu cloud image:
```
  $ kc --arch riscv64 --root ./tmproot
```

 - If the build on a remote build host is failing unexpectedly you may want to
   try cleaning up the remote git repository, running:
```
  $ kc --clean --build-host HOSTNAME
```
